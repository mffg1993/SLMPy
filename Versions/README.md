## GUI vs SCR - Using the correct tool for the problem

I usually need an easy interface to work with an optical setup. However, to automate my experiment, I need a powerful tool for the final measurements. Therefore, I created versions of the code depending on the task at hand. 

The GUI and SCR options of the same version have the same features, but the user interacts through a Graphical User Interface or the command line. 

## Version Summary

- 1.0.2  - Now, it is possible to use the custom color maps. This helps in the efficiency of the SLM
- 1.0.1  - The code was divided into files to improve readability and maintenance.
- 1.0.0  - First release of the code. It was monolithic and a bit complicated to modify
