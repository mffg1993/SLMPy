This project provides a Python-based application for controlling multiple screens, supporting hologram generation and display. The tool is designed for scientific visualization, allowing users to generate and display Laguerre-Gaussian and Hermite-Gaussian holograms, random noise patterns, and gradients across multiple monitors. A version with a GUI  has also been added for the sake of simplicity.

---

## Features
- Control multiple screens simultaneously.
- Generate and display:
  - Laguerre-Gaussian holograms.
  - Hermite-Gaussian holograms.
- Gradients and random noise patterns.
- Support for spatial light modulator (SLM) resolutions.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or later
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PyQt5

---

## Versioning 

 Current Version:

- 1.0.2  - Now, it is possible to use the custom color maps. This helps in the efficiency of the SLM
- 1.0.1  - The code was divided into files to improve readability and maintenance.
- 1.0.0  - First release of the code. It was monolithic and a bit complicated to modify
