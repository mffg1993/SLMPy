This project provides a Python-based application for controlling multiple screens, supporting hologram generation and display. The tool is designed for scientific visualization, allowing users to generate and display Laguerre-Gaussian and Hermite-Gaussian holograms, random noise patterns, and gradients across multiple monitors. A version with a GUI  has also been added for the sake of simplicity.
