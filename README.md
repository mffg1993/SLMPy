Here, you will find multiple versions of the code I developed (with some refinements from ChatGPT) to control various Spatial Light modulators using Python to tailor the scalar complex amplitude of light. 

The GUI version can detect the screens, and create masks for Hermite and Laguerre Gaussian modes. I expect the beam library to be expanded eventually. 


To this point, the code is based only on the method developed by Prof. Ebrahim Karimi in the manuscript *Exact solution to simultaneous intensity and phase encryption with a single phase-only hologram* (https://opg.optica.org/ol/fulltext.cfm?uri=ol-38-18-3546&id=260924)
