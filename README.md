Here, you will find multiple versions of the code I developed (with some refinements from ChatGPT) to control one (and hopefully more) Spatial Light modulator using Python to tailor the scalar complex amplitude of light. 

To this point, the code is based only on the method developed by Prof. Ebrahim Karimi in the manuscript *Exact solution to simultaneous intensity and phase encryption with a single phase-only hologram* ( https://opg.optica.org/ol/fulltext.cfm?uri=ol-38-18-3546&id=260924 )
